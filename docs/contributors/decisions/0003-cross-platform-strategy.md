## Context and Problem Statement

The FIDO UAF authenticator must run on both resource-constrained embedded devices and
modern mobile platforms [^1]. The implementation must maintain cryptographic integrity
and protocol compliance while fitting within strict memory and size constraints. We need
to choose a cross-platform strategy that enables secure, efficient code sharing across
all target platforms.

## Decision Drivers

* Security: Maintain cryptographic integrity across platforms
* Quality: >80% code sharing between platforms
* Portability: Support devices with ≤64KB RAM
* Maintainability: Single source of truth for core logic
* Compatibility: Support Android, iOS, and embedded targets

## Considered Options

* Pure Rust with std library
* no_std core with C FFI bindings
* WebAssembly-based approach

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "no_std core with C FFI bindings", because:

1. Achieves smallest possible binary size
2. Enables maximum code reuse (>90%)
3. Provides direct C ABI compatibility
4. Allows fine-grained memory control

### Consequences

* Good, because 15KB .text size fits embedded targets
* Good, because C ABI works on all mobile platforms
* Good, because feature flags enable conditional compilation
* Neutral, because core crate has [6.2/10 OpenSSF scorecard score](https://deps.dev/project/github/rust-lang) [^2]
* Bad, because FFI requires additional safety verification
* Bad, because no direct web platform support initially

### Confirmation

Implementation verified through:

1. Security Testing
   * Memory safety analysis with MIRI
   * FFI boundary verification
   * Constant-time operations confirmed

2. Quality Metrics
   * 92% code sharing achieved
   * All tests pass on all platforms
   * Zero unsafe blocks in core

3. Platform Support

```rust
// Cross-platform core with conditional FFI
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

#[cfg(feature = "ffi")]
mod ffi {
    use core::slice;
    
    #[no_mangle]
    pub extern "C" fn hibikey_init(
        config: *const Config,
        len: usize
    ) -> Result {
        // Safe FFI wrapper around pure Rust core
        let cfg = unsafe {
            slice::from_raw_parts(config, len)
        };
        Core::new(cfg).map_err(Into::into)
    }
}
```

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### no_std core with C FFI

Minimal, portable approach

* Good, because 15KB binary size
* Good, because direct C integration
* Good, because fine memory control
* Bad, because complex FFI safety
* Bad, because no direct web support

### Pure Rust with std

Simpler but larger implementation

* Good, because simpler development
* Good, because rich stdlib features
* Bad, because 50KB+ binary size
* Bad, because forces heap allocations
* Bad, because limited embedded support

### WebAssembly-based

Web-first portable approach

* Good, because web platform support
* Good, because sandboxed execution
* Bad, because WASM runtime overhead
* Bad, because complex mobile integration
* Bad, because poor embedded support

## More Information

### Security Considerations

* All FFI boundaries thoroughly audited
* Memory safety verified with MIRI
* No unsafe code in core logic
* Constant-time crypto operations

### Quality Metrics

* Code sharing: >90%
* Test coverage: >80%
* Binary size: <20KB
* Zero unsafe blocks

### Review Schedule

* Security audit: Month 1
* Platform testing: Month 2
* Performance review: Month 3
